=== Validators

While it always has, and always will be, our position that opencsv should do just enough
validation to prove that it is working with a CSV file and leave any further validation
to the developer so as to allow opencsv to work for as broad a developer base as possible,
over the last couple of years a number of feature requests, support requests and feature
requests disguised as bug reports have made us realize that we should allow for the _integration_
of user defined validation to give opencsv the best of both worlds.

By allowing integration, developers can inject validations for their specific requirements
without adding performance overhead and an unnecessary burden to the users who do not need them.
